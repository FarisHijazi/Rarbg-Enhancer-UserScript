# Credits
I wrote the script except for one part which is by the following user:
## Darkred
I copied the code of [darkred](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/2160-darkred) from [this script used to add magnet and torrent links](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/23493-rarbg-torrent-and-magnet-links/code).

I also integrated this [script for converting timestamps to relative format](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/21550-rarbg-convert-torrent-timestamps-to-relative-format).

## Cisco
I originally [this script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/12648-rarbg-add-magnet-link) from the user [Cisco](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/16455-cisco).
This is just a shoutout to Cisco for inspiring me to start, as there was no contribution.
